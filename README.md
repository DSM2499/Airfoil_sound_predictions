- **Approach:**
    In this project, I developed a robust predictive model for airfoil-generated sound levels utilizing Apache Spark and advanced machine learning techniques. The process began with the creation of a Spark session to efficiently manage data processing tasks. After acquiring the dataset, I loaded it into a Spark DataFrame and performed initial data cleaning, which included removing duplicate rows and addressing missing values.
    
    The data preprocessing phase involved renaming relevant columns for clarity and saving the cleaned data to a Parquet file, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. Upon reloading the data, I designed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline incorporating feature vectorization, scaling, and linear regression.
    
    To prepare for modeling, I strategically split the dataset into training and testing sets. The pipeline model was then fitted to the training data and subsequently used to generate predictions on the test data. Model performance was rigorously evaluated using multiple regression metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2).
    
    Throughout the development process, I prioritized best practices in code formatting and documentation, ensuring clarity and maintainability of the codebase. The final step involved saving the trained pipeline model for future applications.
    
    This structured approach resulted in the creation of an efficient and scalable predictive model capable of providing valuable insights into airfoil noise levels. The model serves as a powerful tool for engineers and researchers, facilitating data-driven decision-making in airfoil design and noise reduction strategies.
